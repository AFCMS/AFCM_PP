## Workflow

You need the [Hack Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) font installed for the profile picture to render properly.

To modify the profile picture, you need to edit the files in `./src` using Inkscape.

Then you can regenerate all the simple SVG and PNG files just by using `python3 ./export.py` (you still need to have the inkscape executable in your PATH).
