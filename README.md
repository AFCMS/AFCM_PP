# AFCM Profile Picture Source

## Workflow

You need the "Hack Nerd Font" font installed for the profile picture to render properly.

To modify the profile picture, you need to edit the files in `./src` using Inkscape.

Then you can regenerate all the simple SVG and PNG files just by using `python3 ./export.py` (you still need to have the inkscape executable in your PATH).
